A Journey through Innovation
In my current role as a Research Assistant at LiNAR, I focus on one of the most compelling applications of computer vision: the non-invasive assessment of embryos in IVF processes. My work involves developing models to predict viability without the need for biopsies, utilizing advanced time-lapse imaging techniques."><title>About</title><link rel=icon type=image/x-icon href=https://juanlebrero.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png href=https://juanlebrero.com/favicon.png><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/main.5efeca130dc78ba84d14ac924c14a4b5dadfbcac0163ede7b1bc3c21759bc2704ef41737909fe927cf3b93b0624eec5209599f63520c0a0f093a82051fb67592.css integrity="sha512-Xv7KEw3Hi6hNFKySTBSktdrfvKwBY+3nsbw8IXWbwnBO9Bc3kJ/pJ887k7BiTuxSCVmfY1IMCg8JOoIFH7Z1kg=="><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/custom.css></head><body a=auto><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/ accesskey=h title=Home>Juan Francisco Lebrero</a></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=/about/ title=About><span class=active>About</span></a></li><li><a href=/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=/contact/ title=Contact><span>Contact</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><div class=header-controls><ul class=lang-switch><li><a href=/es/about/ aria-label=Español>ES</a></li></ul><button id=theme-toggle class=theme-toggle aria-label="Toggle theme">

My work involves developing models to predict viability without the need for biopsies, utilizing advanced time-lapse imaging techniques.</p><p>Simultaneously, I contribute to the data science efforts at SOFLEX. There, we face the challenge of processing and understanding human language within the context of public safety. I have directed the training of language models tailored to Argentine Spanish and the development of intelligence platforms that analyze millions of incidents in real-time, enabling faster and more precise emergency responses.</p><p>My experience also spans the industrial and educational sectors. At Papelera San Andrés de Giles, I implemented multimodal vision systems for large-scale product detection and verification. At UK University Mexico, I led the AI strategy to optimize educational content production and lead management, demonstrating how technology can efficiently scale complex operations. Previously, at Notimation, I explored agent orchestration and RAG systems to streamline human-information interaction.</p><h2 id=perspective-and-tools>Perspective and Tools</h2><p>I view programming and model design as essential tools for solving complex problems. I move fluently between languages such as Python, C/C++, and CUDA, building solutions on modern cloud infrastructures and databases. My academic background has allowed me to specialize in NLP, Computer Vision, and generative models, always with a practical focus.</p><p>Beyond code, I enjoy the challenges of competitive programming and constant innovation. I have had the honor of qualifying for the ICPC regionals and being recognized in various technical competitions—milestones that reflect my commitment to excellence and continuous learning.</p><h2 id=contact>Contact</h2><p>If you would like to discuss technology, research, or potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out:</p><ul><li><strong>GitHub</strong>: <a href=https://github.com/frizynn>frizynn</a></li><li><strong>LinkedIn</strong>: <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/lebrero-juan-francisco/>Juan Francisco Lebrero</a></li><li><strong>Email</strong>: <a href=mailto:lebrerojuanfrancisco@gmail.com>lebrerojuanfrancisco@gmail.com</a></li><li><strong>Buenos Aires, Argentina</strong></li></ul></article></div></main></body></html>
