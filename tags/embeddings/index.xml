It was a huge advancement because it stopped relying exclusively on finding similar text and started understanding implicit relationships between entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after implementing it and using it in projects, I encountered some friction points. The most obvious one is having to choose between &amp;ldquo;Local&amp;rdquo; mode and &amp;ldquo;Global&amp;rdquo; mode before making a query. That works well in theory, but in practice it forces you to think: &amp;ldquo;Does this question need specific detail or broad synthesis?&amp;rdquo; And the answer is often &amp;ldquo;both,&amp;rdquo; which leaves you with a design problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
